## [V13] â€“ 2025-10-22
### Policy: Patch-Only Updates
- All code changes for V13+ are delivered as **downloadable .patch files**.
- Apply via **Android Studio â†’ VCS â†’ Apply Patchâ€¦** (no terminal required).
- Each patch:
    - Is self-contained (adds/replaces only whatâ€™s needed)
    - Compiles against current `V13-dev`
    - Includes a one-line commit message suggestion
    - Avoids touching Gradle/project roots unless explicitly stated

### Changes in this release
- Replaced legacy scaffold with a clean **Top App Bar** + gear.
- **Settings** owns its `Divider`; **PythonSkillTile** is layout-free (reusable).
