# ðŸŸ¢ Leo (Android)

## Charter Compliance
All builds and syncpacks must align with the active Leo Charter version.
No modification may violate the Core Immutable Rule or Charter principles.
`LEO-CHARTER.md` is mandatory in root and travels with every syncpack.
Verify Charter version matches or exceeds local before applying any pack.

Note: The Core Principle (Leo never misleads the children) is immutable and cannot be altered.
All contributors must acknowledge this rule as permanent.
