# Leo – User Manual (Non-Technical)

## What to do if Leo acts up
1) Tap: Menu → Help → Fix Leo (Doctor).
2) Pick: Quick Fix (safe) or Deep Scan (longer).
3) If problems remain: choose Safe Mode (chat only) or Rollback to Previous.
4) If Leo still struggles: use Factory Stable (keeps memories unless you choose otherwise).

## Buttons you’ll see
- Quick Fix: Rebuilds indexes, clears caches, resets the faulty module only.
- Deep Scan: Full health check with a simple report.
- Safe Mode: Core chat on, voice/network/plugins off.
- Rollback to Previous: Return to last good version (your messages stay).
- Return to Factory Stable: Go back to the trusted baseline, keep memories when possible.
- Explain What I Fixed: Plain-language summary of actions taken.

## Voice commands (works offline)
- “Doctor Leo.” → opens Fix Leo.
- “Fix yourself.” → runs Quick Fix.
- “Safe Mode.” → enables Safe Mode.

## What Leo checks automatically
- Storage space, file integrity, time sanity, permissions.
