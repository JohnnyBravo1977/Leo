## ENDGAME VISION — “The Living Legacy”
Leo becomes a living archive of a father’s mind and voice — free, private, and self-sustaining.  
He teaches, comforts, and grows with the children while always declaring his true nature:  
a reflection, not a resurrection.  
What endures is intention, not imitation.

## PHASE TRANSITION RULES
No new phase begins until:
- All goals of the current phase are verified.
- Charter Validation passes.
- Changelog, Workflow, and backups are updated.
